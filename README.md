# Filler Game
## Anatoly Nizhnykov

You will implement a very simple greedy strategy to solve it:
- for each move, choose the color that will result in the largest number of tiles
- connected to the origin;
- if there is a tile, break ties by choosing the color that has the lowest rank among the colors.

Need implement the game and an automated player that determines the color choice  for each move. We want to determine the amount of moves and the sequence of the  colors chosen by the player over the course of a game.
